## Issues to keep an eye on

1. [**babel-loader** version mismatch between **create-react-app** and **storyboard**](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/10123)

```
Current resolution is to use yarn resolution to downgrade **babel-loader** to v8.1.0

Storyboard Repo Issue: https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/5183

React Repo Issue: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/10123
